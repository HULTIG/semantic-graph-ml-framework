## MAPE - K Loop Scenario

To demonstrate the use of this project we have the following scenario:

## Example Use Case: Healthcare Monitoring
- **Scenario:** Healthcare Monitoring Monitor patient health using IoT devices and environmental data.
- **Steps:**
  1. Transform sensor data to RDF.
  2. Enrich RDF with semantic annotations and context with R2RML mapping scripts.
  3. Build a knowledge graph.
  4. Use Graph ML to detect anomalies or predict patient risk.
  5. Trigger adaptive actions(e.g., caregiver notifications, environment adjustments).

- **Initial Context:** A patient wears a health monitoring device that collects data such as heart rate, activity levels, and environmental conditions.The smart home system also monitors fridge usage to assess eating patterns.

- **Trigger for Adaptation:**
  - The system detects a high heart rate, sedentary activity, and lack of fridge usage, which might indicate a health risk(e.g., dehydration or skipped meals).

- **Adaptation:**
  - Notify the caregiver and suggest actions(e.g., reminding the patient to drink water).
  - Adjust room temperature for comfort if environmental conditions are suboptimal.

### Monitoring

The RDF mappings will represent the data collected from the environment and other sensors:
- Input: Sensor readings from devices and user activity logs.
- Process: Convert this raw data into semantically enriched RDF using your mappings.
- Example Output:

### Analysis

The analysis is performed by SPARQL queries that applies reasoning into the collected data to identify potential health risks:
- Example Query: Check for high heart rate and low activity.

```sparql
PREFIX sosa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/>
PREFIX fhir: <http://hl7.org/fhir/>
PREFIX ucum: <http://unitsofmeasure.org/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?observation ?result ?property ?resultTime ?sensor ?patient
WHERE {
  ?observation a sosa:Observation ;
               sosa:hasSimpleResult ?result ;
               sosa:observedProperty ?property ;
               sosa:resultTime ?resultTime .
               
  OPTIONAL { ?observation sosa:madeBySensor ?sensor . }
  OPTIONAL { ?observation fhir:Patient.identifier ?patient . }
}
ORDER BY ?resultTime
```

### Planning

We can use the analysis results to plan adaptive action like:
- If the query returns results, generate a notification for the caregiver.
- Plan to adjust the room temperature or suggest actions to the user.

### Execution:

At this point customized actions can be performed to execute the planned adaptation using automated actuators or notifications.
- Example: Send a message to the caregiver via email / SMS.

### Knowledge:
- The feedback from the execution phase can be used to update the knowledge graph and improve future decision-making processes.
- The system can learn from past actions and outcomes to refine its adaptive strategies.
- The Semantic Framework for Data Interoperability in IoT and Healthcare Systems provides an approach to integrating semantically technologies events and machine learning.

## Installation

To demonstrate the framework for this self - adaptive system scenario we have to setup the environment with the following components and dependencies:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For running the Spring Boot API, Apache Jena, and demo notebook with its dependencies.

Without the docker environment, you can run the Spring Boot API and the notebook separately.
- **Java 17**: Required for running RMLMapper and the Spring Boot API.
- **Maven**: For building the Spring Boot API.
- **Python 3.8 +**: For Graph ML workflows and required libraries:
  - PyTorch Geometric
  - Scikit - learn
  - NetworkX
  - Matplotlib

### Setup

#### 1. **Download and Set Up RMLMapper**
RMLMapper is used for transforming data to RDF.

1. Download **RMLMapper version 6.5.1**:
```bash
wget wget https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases/download/v6.5.1/rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar -O rmlmapper.jar
```

2. Move the downloaded file to the appropriate directory(e.g., `scripts/`):
```bash
mv rmlmapper.jar scripts/
mv rmlmapper.jar src/RelationalToRDFAPI/src/main/resources/jar/
```

3. Verify the installation:
```bash
java -jar scripts/rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar -h
```

You should see the help menu for RMLMapper.

#### 2. **Start the Environment**
Use Docker Compose to bootstrap the Apache Jena Fuseki triple store, the Spring Boot API, and the notebook that demonstrates Graph ML workflows.

```bash
# src/
docker-compose up -d --build # Build and start the services
```

This command will start the following services:
- **Apache Jena Fuseki**: Triple store for storing RDF data.
- **Spring Boot API**: RESTful API for R2RML mapping and RDF generation from JSON data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Graph ML demo notebook that showcases node classification and link prediction tasks from RDF data.

To stop the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

With the services running, you can proceed with the following steps to interact with the API and the notebook:
- **Access the Spring Boot API**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- **Access the Jupyter Notebook**: `http://localhost:8888/lab`
- **Jupyter Notebook Token**: Check the terminal output for the token to access the notebook.
- **Apache Jena Fuseki**: `http://localhost:3030`
- **Fuseki Admin**: `http://localhost:3030/dataset.html`
- **Fuseki SPARQL Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3030/ds/query`

Without docker environment you can run the Spring Boot API and the notebook separately, the dependencies for the notebook are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## How to Run

The following steps demonstrate how to run the Spring Boot API and the Jupyter Notebook to interact with the system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HULTIG/safir-self-adaptive-semantic-framework.git

cd safir-self-adaptive-semantic-framework

# Download the RMLMapper JAR
wget https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases/download/v6.5.1/rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar

mkdir src/RelationalToRDFAPI/src/main/resources/jar/

# Copy the JAR to the appropriate directories
mv rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar src/RelationalToRDFAPI/src/main/resources/jar/

# Start the environment - it will take some time to build the services for the first time due to dependencies
docker-compose -f src/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build

# Access the Spring Boot API
curl http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

# Access the Jupyter Notebook by copying the token from the terminal output of the notebook service
docker ps --filter "name=notebook" --format "{{.ID}}" | xargs -I {} docker logs {} | grep ?token
```

> **NOTE**: The current implementation uses a simulated environment with artificial data. For real-world scenarios, you can replace the data sources with actual IoT devices, sensors, and healthcare systems data consedring data privacy and regulations concerns.

After setting up the environment, it should be available the demo notebook and the Spring Boot API to interact with the process flow.

TODO: Add video demo

To test the rml mappings and the RDF generation you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure the rmmlapper is downloaded and placed in the correct directory
wget https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/releases/download/v6.5.1/rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar

mv rmlmapper-6.5.1-r371-all.jar scripts/

# Run the script to generate the RDF
chmod +x scripts/generate_rdf.sh

# Base RML mapping script
scripts/generate_rdf.sh rml/source_a/source_a_rml.ttl rdf/input.ttl

# Semantically Improved RML mapping script
scripts/generate_rdf.sh rml/source_a/source_a_rml_imp.ttl rdf/source_a_rml_imp_output.ttl

# Semantically enriched RML mapping script
scripts/generate_rdf.sh rml/source_a/source_a_rml_unified.ttl rdf/output.ttl
```
