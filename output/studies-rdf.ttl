Although the outcome in younger adults has improved because of cytarabine- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy with advanced supportive care and introduction of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the benefit associated with standard intensive chemotherapy in older patients remain debatable. Life expectancy in elderly patients is a function of age, disability and comorbidity, performance score, along with leukemia characteristics such as genetic alterations or white blood cell count at diagnosis 'Older' patients are generally considered those aged 60 years or older.~Intensive chemotherapy delivered to the very elderly with AML (patients _70 years of age), may not be beneficial to most and could be harmful to some. However, these patients are often referred to as 'unfit' or ineligible for intensive remission induction therapy. In daily practice, the final decision to treat intensively or not is made by the treating hematologist on a case by case basis according to patient's age, cytogenetics, performance score, concomitant diseases and type of AML (de novo or secondary).~In older patients considered 'unfit' for intensive treatment, LD-AraC has been demonstrated to be more beneficial than best supportive care and hydroxyurea. The recent availability of new drugs that may have an improved side effect profile and in some cases bioavailability may offer future improvement for this patient population. The efficacy of hypomethylating agents has been studied in older AML patients with conflicting results. Recent publications refined prognostic information, which not only optimize existing treatments but also could lead to the development of additional targeted therapeutic approaches.~In this study, the investigators focus on patients with AML (_20% blasts) aged 70 or older seen in our institution over a 14-year period.

The prognosis of this progressive and neurodegenerative disease after diagnosis may differ between individuals. In its broadest sense, the prognosis after a diagnosis of dementia; can be defined by shortening of life span, high level of cognitive and functional loss, decrease in quality of life and increased need for care. However, the prognosis of different types of dementia is highly variable. Because it is the most common type of dementia, studies are usually on Alzheimer's disease. It constitutes 50-75% of total dementia cases. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and accounts for approximately 15% of dementia cases. Dementia with Lewy bodies constitutes 10-20% of the total dementia patients and ranks second among degenerative dementia types. Frontotemporal dementia, which mimics psychiatric disorders and has prominent behavioural problems, and Parkinson's disease-associated dementia, which is characterized by cognitive impairment that can be added to the existing picture in Parkinson's patients, are also counted among other types of dementia. Prognosis-related data on dementia types other than Alzheimer's disease are limited in the literature. Determining the prognosis is important to support patients, anticipate long-term health problems, plan physician and healthcare provision, and support patients with dementia.In view of the lack of sufficient data on dementia types other than Alzheimer's disease, it is aimed to contribute to the literature on this subject and to determine the factors that may affect prognosis, morbidity and mortality in patients belonging to all dementia types.";

All patients will underwent re-staging TUR 4-5 weeks later. All clinical assessors are adequately trained in the above procedures, and no methods are used to enhance the quality of measurements. All biopsy samples of tumour and bladder will be reviewed by a pathologist for stage and grade. Tumour stage are classified according to the 1997 TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer, and tumour grade was defined in accordance with the 1973 WHO classification.~Treatment schedule All patients will start induction EMDA/MMC of 6 intravesical treatments at weekly intervals commencing 2-3 weeks after re-staging TUR. Intravesical EMDA MMC is given by a battery-powered generator delivering a controlled electric current that passes between the active intravesical electrode integrated into a specific transurethral catheter and dispersive ground electrodes on skin of the lower abdomen (Physion srl, Mirandola, Italy). Patients are placed on fluid restriction and 2 g ingested sodium bicarbonate the night before treatment, the morning of treatment, and 2 h before treatment with mitomycin. The bladder is emptied through the electrode-transurethral-catheter and 40 mg mitomycin dissolved in 100 mL water was infused intravesically by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min, while 20 mA for 30 min pulsed electric current was given externally. Two dispersive cathode electrodes were placed on lower abdominal skin that had been degreased with alcohol. The bladder was then emptied and the catheter removed.~Patients who were disease-free 3 months after treatment were scheduled to receive monthly infusions of BCG for 10 months. Maintenance treatment was given to the same dose and methods of infusion as initial allocated treatment. Response to treatment was assessed with abdominal ultrasonography, cystoscopy, and urinary cytology. In patients who were free of disease 3 months after treatment, these assessments were done every 3 months during the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with carcinoma in situ underwent abdominal ultrasonography, cystoscopy, urinary cytology, and random bladder biopsies at 3 months and 6 months. If bladder cytology was positive for cancer cells but no lesions were visible on cystoscopy, cytology of the upper urinary tract and random biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra were done. If, at 3 months' follow-up, carcinoma in situ persisted or a superficial tumour recurred (ie, stage pTa tumour confined to the urothelium or stage pT1 with invasion of the lamina propria), the patient underwent multiple, random biopsy sampling and TUR of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy and received a second course of intervention treatment.~Cystoscopy, biopsies, and urinary cytology were repeated 3 months after the start of the second course. Patients who were disease-free after the second course of treatment received the full course of monthly maintenance instillations (ie, one infusion of electromotive mitomycin for 10).~Patients were suspended from the trial on a second recurrence, on persistence of carcinoma in situ, on development of carcinoma in the upper-urinary tract or prostatic urethra, on progression to muscle-invasive disease (ie, stage pT2 or more advanced), or on development of metastases. Further treatment was left to the discretion of the local investigator.~Toxicity Side effects were classified as local, systemic or allergic. Local toxicity was defined as culture proven bacterial cystitis, drug induced (chemical) cystitis and other localized effects. Systemic side effects were defined as fever exceeding 38C, general malaise and fatigue. Skin rash was regarded as allergic reaction. The severity of side effects were classified by the treating physician, with subsequent decision to continue, delay or abandon treatment.~Patient follow-up. Response to treatment was assessed with cystoscopy, urinary cytology and /or biopsy only if indicated by suspicious cytological findings or on cystoscopy. In disease-free cases, cystoscopy and urinary cytology were repeated at 3-month intervals for 2 years, 6-month intervals for 3 years and yearly thereafter.~Patient evaluation Patients with stage pTa and pT1 tumour without carcinoma in situ are classified as disease-free and therefore treated prophylactically; those with carcinoma in situ are treated therapeutically, and response is scored as no response or as complete response. Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of carcinoma in situ, as documented by a normal cytology, cystoscopy, and random bladder biopsies.~The primary endpoint is disease-free interval for patients without carcinoma in situ and for patients with carcinoma in situ who are disease-free after treatment-ie, time from enrollment to first cystoscopy noting recurrence. Patients with carcinoma in situ who did not have complete response after 3 months of treatment are regarded as having recurrence with no follow-up. The secondary endpoints are time to progression, overall survival, and disease specific survival. Time to progression is defined as time from randomisation until the onset of muscle invasive disease as recorded by pathological assessment of TUR samples or biopsy samples. Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment until death from any cause; disease specific survival as time from enrollment until death from bladder cancer. Patients without recurrence or progression are censored at the last cystoscopy, and those lost to follow-up were censored at the last known day of survival.~Statistical Analysis All analyses are done by intention to treat. Time to first recurrence, time to progression, overall survival, and disease-specific survival are estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons are estimated by use of log-rank test. All tests are two-sided, and p<0·05 was regarded as significant. The investigators will calculated hazard ratios with 95% CI by use of proportional-hazards regression.";

Some of these factors such as TNM stage, lymphatic and perineural invasion and vascular emboli have been found to affect recurrence free survival in most studies. While the impact of other factors such as distal resection margin, tumor size, extra capsular spread and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on recurrence remains controversial. Moreover, most of the previous studies on prognostic factors have been from American and European countries with very little data from African countries. Recognition of these factors helps in identification of high-risk patients who require close and more rigorous postoperative surveillance. Hence this study was conducted to determine the factors affecting recurrence after curative resection of rectal cancer in African population.";

Although HXLPE have been reported to reduce polyethylene wear, there is concerned about a potential decrease in toughness, tensile strength and resistance to the propagation of fatigue cracks in a long-term follow-up.~Several noncomparative studies of COC and COP THA have reported promising results in terms of Harris hip scores, radiographic findings, and survival rates, yet we are aware of no long-term comparative clinical studies with a COC THA and a COP THA in the same younger patients. This study aimed to see if long-term Harris hip scores and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score better in younger patients with a COC THA compared with those with a COP THA.";

Poor survival has been demonstrated in adolescents and young adults compared to children with DLBCL. However, the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) LNH-97 study showed that age was not a poor prognostic factor in children and adolescents with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and DLBCL. A conclusion as to whether adolescent age is an independent risk factor has not been reached.~At present, the preferred protocols for adolescent DLBCL patients have not been standardized. Adolescents with cancer have been designated as a vulnerable population, positioned between children and the adult population. Treatment strategies differ between adults and pediatric patients. The pediatric strategy for DLBCL was developed in parallel by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) and French-American-British/Lymphomes Malins B (FAB/LMB) groups. The combination of rituximab plus Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens are the standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with DLBCL. There is currently a lack of studies that have compared the treatment outcomes in adolescent patients with DLBCL who were administered pediatric or adult regimens.

The following models will be run to provide all persons and sex-specific estimates, considering exposure to each mental disorder and whether the association differs depending on the time since onset of the mental disorder (lagged HRs):~Model A: adjusted for sex and birth date which, in combination with underlying age in the models, adjusts also for calendar time~Model B: additionally adjust for mental disorder comorbidity with onset before, but not after, the mental disorder of interest~Finally, cumulative incidence proportions of diagnosis with a GMC after being diagnosed with a mental disorder will be estimated. This will provide absolute risks of developing a GMC after a specific time, given a previous diagnosis of a mental disorder. To compare cumulative incidence proportions among people diagnosed with a mental disorder to those among people without a diagnosis, a matched reference group will be generated for each mental disorder. For every index person with the mental disorder, up to five age- and sex-matched individuals (who had not received a diagnosis of the relevant mental disorder by the age the index person was diagnosed) will be randomly selected. Cumulative incidence proportions will be generated for each reference group. All analyses will be performed on the secured platform of Statistics Denmark STATA/MP version 15.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).~An interactive webpage will be developed to visualize all results from this study.

  ex:brief_summaries "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis with high satisfaction rate. However, the traditional cutting jigs for distal femur cutting inevitably violates the medullary canal of femoral bone. The process of intramedullary reaming for the insertion of distal femur cutting jigs stimulated the dissipation of marrow emboli that reported lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac stress perioperatively. There are emerging refinements aiming to reduce the insult to the medullary canal of the distal femur as well as to improve the prosthetic alignment, such as navigation assisted TKA or robotic surgery.~In addition to better prosthetic alignment, computer-assisted navigation TKAs also mitigate perioperative blood loss and systemic emboli. The publication previously published by the investigators showed that navigation TKAs can lead to lesser extent of elevation of endothelial injury markers than the traditional TKAs. However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming seem to be multi-dimensional and the whole picture has not been elucidated clearly at present.~Previous studies have shown that operative trauma can trigger marked immune responses. Operative procedures can simultaneously stimulate the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory response, with 80% of the leucocyte transcriptome being affected. Most studies of hip or knee surgery found that operation-triggered immune reactions are associated with postoperative recovery, infection, and even mortality.~The navigation TKAs avoid the process of intra-medullary reaming, which is the mandatory part of conventional TKA for the distal femur cutting. The investigators hypothesize that the reaming process may exert substantial inflammatory response, which can be manifested by higher level of inflammatory markers in the serum and hemovac drainage samples obtained from the participants undergoing conventional TKAs.";

However, studies have shown significant heterogeneity in the performances of GFR equations when applied in kidney recipients, which may be attributed to variations and intrinsic characteristics specific to the transplant population. We thus made the hypothesis that GFR equations developed on a large, well-phenotyped kidney recipient cohort might achieve good performances in predicting mGFR.~The project therefore aims to:~Develop new kidney-recipient-specific (KRS) GFR equations and compare their performances with the standard GFR equations~Investigate whether the use of race increasers the performances of the new kidney-recipient-specific (KRS) GFR equations~Evaluate the effects of the new equations on the chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence and GFR stage~This study will provide us with data of kidney transplant patients that may allow the development of a new KRS GFR equation.~A new KRS GFR equation that presents with increased performances, as compared to current GFR equations, will improve the GFR calculation in kidney recipients, and therefore improve clinical decisions and the long-term kidney allograft management. Decisions regarding the return to dialysis or placement on the transplant waiting list will be taken with more accuracy and therefore potentially improve the financial allocation of kidney transplantation for the society.";

During the last decades, there has been a paradigm shift in both diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis - surgical treatment has changed from open to laparoscopic appendectomy (3). Acute appendicitis has traditionally been a clinical diagnosis, but the use of preoperative diagnostic imaging has, in some countries, increased dramatically (4). The use of computed tomography (CT) before appendectomy is in the United States up to 90%, in England 13% and in Holland almost all patients undergo ultrasound and/or CT before appendectomy (1).~The use of antibiotics can be successful in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis verified on CT, and the use of CT has significantly lowered the negative appendectomy rate compared to clinical evaluation only (1). But the use of CT is inevitably inducing radiation and increasing lifetime risk of cancer - especially in younger patients who most frequently present with acute appendicitis (1,5). It is estimated that CT of the abdominal region can avoid 12 negative appendectomies but at the cost of one cancer death due to radiation (5).

  ex:brief_title "Reversal of an Unfavorable Effect of Hydrochlorothiazide Compared to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor on Serum Uric Acid and Oxypurines Levels by Estrogen-progestin Therapy in Hypertensive Postmenopausal Women.";
  ex:detailed_descriptions "Hyperuricemia is considered one of the risk factors for arterial hypertension in postmenopausal women. The recent analysis by Loeffler confirmed that, as indicated in the NHANES survey, uric acid is a powerful cardiovascular risk factor.Analysis of age and sex strata in a meta-analysis showed hyperuricemia to be independently predictive of new-onset hypertension with a stronger association in women. In women, a positive relationship was found between age and serum uric acid levels. This phenomenon can also be explained by impaired renal uric acid excretion progressing with age. Moreover, menopause is independently associated with higher serum uric acid levels, whereas postmenopausal hormone use is associated with lower uric acid levels among postmenopausal women.~According to the guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension, first-line drugs in hypertensive elderly patients also include thiazide diuretics. This is particularly justified in postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis because thiazides have a positive effect on calcium balance, which is disordered in postmenopausal women. The natriuretic effect of thiazide diuretics itself is also desired due to increased sodium sensitivity after menopause. Meta-analysis performed by Mussini et al. covering 60 studies with thiazide diuretics in antihypertensive therapy (from years 1946-2014) showed their superiority in reducing pulse pressure over other classes of antihypertensive drugs. However; at the same time, it is known that thiazides increase serum uric acid levels.It has been suggested that increase in serum uric acid caused by diuretic treatment may partially offset the benefits of blood pressure reduction. This has been confirmed in an analysis of data from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) that showed that increase in uric acid levels in hypertensive patients treated with diuretics was associated with smaller clinical benefits from antihypertensive therapy assessed as a risk for episodes of ischemic heart disease.~Since menopause depends to a great extent on age, it is difficult to separate the influence of uric acid levels and its renal clearance on the development of hyperuricemia. This is possible to achieve only if uric acid metabolism is compared in postmenopausal women receiving and not receiving estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT). A potential factor limiting the unfavorable effect of thiazides on uric acid levels in hypertensive women may be EPT. Mihmanli et al. demonstrated benefits from estrogen supplementation on the renal vessels. Experimental studies on rats showed that estrogens (through a non-genomic mechanism of action) have a vasodilating effect on the renal arteries due to the mechanism of endothelium generating nitric oxide by 17-B-estradiol; and through the NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms, estrogens have a suppressive effect on its vasoconstrictive activity. Moreover, Xiao et al. demonstrated the effect of estradiol on regression of hardening of the renal glomeruli.~Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the effect of EPT on serum levels of uric acid and its precursors and on its renal excretion in postmenopausal women receiving antihypertensive treatment with ACEI or thiazide diuretics as well as to explain if EPT prevents hyperuricemia caused by thiazide diuretics in postmenopausal hypertensive patients.~Methods Subjects: Treatment-naive postmenopausal women with recently diagnosed essential hypertension (grade 1 or 2 according to ESH(European Society of Hypertension)/ESC(European Society of Cardiology) 2013 guidelines) were included in the study. They were assessed by a primary care physician or gynecologist as postmenopausal, with age ranging from 49 to 53 years old, of Caucasian race. The final menstrual period (FMP) was identified retrospectively. In order to determine this criterion, I used STRAW (Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop) guidelines. According to the authors, a lack of menstruation for 12 months indicates clinical menopause and is referred to as postmenopause. All the women had the expected postmenopausal increase in follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations (FSH 78.32 ± 8.73 IU/ml) and experienced flushes or other vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. For this reason and due to hypertension, they were randomized to EPT and hypotensive treatment. Normotensive women with vasomotor symptoms received randomly either EPT or nothing. The exclusion criteria included: breast cancer in a first-degree relative, hyperplasia diagnosed by endometrial biopsy, history of thromboembolic diseases, current or history of use of estrogen-progestin therapy or contraceptives, diabetes, kidney failure, thyroid disease, and heart and other chronic diseases (secondary hypertension, atrial fibrillation). Results of mammography performed 12 months prior to the study were negative in all the screened women.~In the invitation letter, women with arterial hypertension were invited to take part in a study on hypertension management and menopause-related symptoms, or menopause-related symptoms only in normotensive women. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects prior to the study. The study was carried out in accordance with The Declaration of Helsinki and was also registered and approved by the local Ethics Committee at the University of Medical Sciences in Poznan with the registration number 1319/99. A physical examination and biochemical screening was performed in all women at baseline.~Study design: The screening phase included 140 women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. They met inclusion, but not exclusion criteria, and were treatment-naive for hypertension. At two separate visits at a weekly interval (wash-out period), hypertension was defined as the mean of three office-based measurements between ?140/90 mmHg and <180/110 mmHg. Subjects included in the study had no contraindications to transdermal estrogen-progestin therapy or hypotensive treatment. The study's control group consisted of 40 normotensive women (<140/90 mmHg, measured at two separate visits under similar conditions) who had also the possibility to receive transdermal estrogen-progestin therapy due to vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.~At the beginning of the study, hypertensive women were assigned randomly (sealed envelopes) to two treatment groups: with a diuretic - hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day p.o. (n=50) or with an ACEI - perindopril 4 mg/day p.o. (n=50), and to a group receiving estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT+) and a group not receiving hormones (EPT-). Normotensive women were assigned randomly only to either EPT+ or EPT- groups. Estrogen-progestin therapy was given in the form of transdermal patches releasing 17?-estradiol (0.05 mg/24 hours) and norethisterone (0.25 mg/24 hours) Estracomb TTS®.~Control measurements were performed in all subjects after one year. At the end, 20 females did not complete the study (4 due to an adverse reaction of perindopril in the form of cough, 6 needed additional antihypertensive therapy - 2 with ACEI and 4 with HCTZ and 10 for no reason). All females from the normotensive group completed the trial.~Finally, groups of 20 women with hypertension in each treatment group and 20 women with normal blood pressure, treated with or without EPT, were chosen for statistical analyses in the order in which they had finished the 12-month follow-up of the study.~Measurements: Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) office-based blood pressure was measured after five minutes in sitting position by means of a validated automatic device (Omron 705 CP) placed on the arm with higher blood pressure. In each time, the average of three measurements was used. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in all study participants at entrance and after 6 and 12 months using an automatic device (MOBIL-O-GRAPH). The device was set up to perform a blood pressure recording every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night, over a 24-hour period. 80% of the correct measurements were needed to validate the result.~Measurement of renal function: Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured as the clearance of 125I-iodohippuran using a constant infusion technique with timed urine sampling [20]. Based on RPF, additional renal hemodynamic parameters: filtration fraction (FF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were estimated [21].~Laboratory tests: Serum and urine creatinine levels were determined with a spectrophotometric method [22] using an autoanalyzer (MEGA, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and the Mascot software package (Matrix Science, UK). Serum and urine uric acid levels were determined with an enzymatic uricase method using PAP 150 kits by bioMérieux SA (Marcy l'Etoile, France). Serum hypoxanthine and xanthine levels were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [23] using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 system with UV detector by HP Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, USA).~Serum creatinine levels were determined using Jaffé reaction. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for women.~Statistical analysis: Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables and the normality of distribution of an investigated feature in both study populations. T-test with the Cochran-Cox adjustment was used in cases where variances of analyzed variables in both study populations differed, or Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test in cases where there were no normal distribution.~Baseline characteristics were compared using ANOVA (in the case of parametric variables) or by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test (in the case of nonparametric variables); subsequently, the different groups were compared in pairs. Means were compared by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test one-way analysis of ranks; then, the relevant groups were compared in pairs. If the groups differed significantly, multiple comparison Dunn test was applied.~Multiple linear regression models were constructed for selected parameters of the effects of HCTZ and EPT (women with arterial hypertension). Models with interactions were also developed. If ? regression coefficients for interactions of independent variables were significant, these models were used to interpret the variability of the dependent variable. F-test verifies the statistical significance of all variables in the model. Similar multiple linear regression models were also constructed to show the effect of hypertension and EPT.~Values represent mean ± standard deviation (SD) if not stated otherwise. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.";

  ex:brief_title "Cornea Donor Study";
  ex:detailed_descriptions "The study enrolled 1101 subjects with a corneal disease considered to be at moderate risk for failure (principally Fuchs' dystrophy and pseudophakic corneal edema). A donor cornea meeting the following criteria was assigned to the subject by one of 43 participating eye banks:~donor age 10 to 75 years~endothelial cell count 2300 to 3300~tissue quality very good to excellent~death to preservation time <12 hrs if body refrigerated or eyes on ice and <8 hrs if not~death to surgery time <5 days~The cornea surgeon (investigator) and patient were masked to donor age and characteristics of the donor cornea. Preoperative management, surgical technique, and postoperative care, including prescription of medications, were provided according to each investigator's customary routine. The follow-up visit schedule for the initial six months was left to each investigator's discretion and after this time the minimum follow-up visit schedule included a visit between six and 12 months and then one visit every 12 months through five years. The primary study outcome was graft survival at five years. The definition of graft failure, based on the definition used in Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies, was a regraft or, in the absence of regraft, a cloudy cornea in which there was loss of central graft clarity sufficient to compromise vision for a minimum of three consecutive months. Follow-up in the initial phase of the study continued for five years unless the patient had a regraft of the study eye.~For the ABO compatibility study, the ABO blood type of both the donor and recipient were determined in order to compare the rate of graft failure for ABO-compatible cases with the rate for ABO-incompatible cases.~For the Specular Microscopy Ancillary Study, endothelial cell counts were determined from specular images by a central reading center, and the relationship of the cell counts to donor age were assessed. In the initial phase of the study, specular images were obtained at 6 months, and then annually through five years post-transplant.~Five-year follow up was completed in November 2007. The 5-year cumulative probability of success was 86%: 86% in the <66.0 year donor age group and 86% in the >=66.0 year donor age group (difference = 0%, upper limit of one-sided 95% confidence interval = 4%). Adjusting for baseline endothelial cell density had no appreciable effect on these results. In a statistical model with donor age as a continuous variable, there was not a significant relationship between donor age and outcome (P=0.11). Three graft failures were due to primary donor failure, 8 to uncorrectable refractive error, 48 to graft rejection, 46 to endothelial decompensation, and 30 to other causes. At least one probable or definite graft rejection episode preceded graft failure in 23 of the 46 failures attributed to endothelial decompensation (4 definite and 19 probable) and in 18 of the 30 failures attributed to other causes (4 definite and 14 probable). The distribution of causes of failure between the donor age groups did not substantially differ.~Although the 5-year results indicated no difference in the success rate of moderate-risk transplants according to donor age, results from the SMAS indicated that among the successful cases, there was a slight association between donor age and endothelial cell loss, with the cell loss after 5 years being slightly lower in corneas from younger donors (r adjusted for baseline endothelial cell density = -0.19, 95% confidence interval -0.29 to -0.08). Whether this slight association between cell loss and donor age is of clinical importance is not known. Of perhaps even greater importance, however, was the finding that irrespective of donor age, endothelial cell loss was substantial over the first five years after transplant even when the graft had been successful. Half of the successful cases experienced a cell loss of 70% or more, and at five years more than half had an endothelial cell density <800 cells/mm2.~Patients in the CDS continued in annual follow up through 2012 in order to to determine the overall 10-year survival rate for moderate risk grafts and to determine whether the graft-failure rate is related to donor age. Additional objectives included determining the value of endothelial cell density in predicting graft failure and evaluating donor and recipient characteristics that may be predictive of late graft failure. All CDS subjects who were active at the 5-year exam were eligible for the extended follow-up phase.~As part of the Specular Microscopy Ancillary Study, follow-up images were obtained during the extended follow-up phase at 7-8 years and again at 10-years. The same procedures used during the first 5 years were followed for the grading of the 7-8 year and 10-year images.";

Particularly the patient's immune and nutritional status have been recently associated with short- and long-term outcome in gastric and other cancers. In addition, there is growing evidence that systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and, more recently, the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to be independently correlated with prognosis in patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery, and preoperative albumin and cholesterol levels seem to be adequate mirrors of the nutritional status of the host.~The investigators have already demonstrated that a new scoring system, which they called Naples prognostic score (NPS), based on a composite score of albumin and cholesterol concentrations, along with NLR and LMR is a simple tool strongly associated with long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.~The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between the NPS and clinicopathological characteristics, postoperative complication rate and long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Furthermore, the new prognostic scoring system will be compared with previously developed ones and the current TNM staging system to evaluate its performance.~All patients who underwent surgery for proven gastric adenocarcinoma at the Division of Surgical Oncology of the Gastrointestinal Tract of the University of Campania (Naples, Italy), from January 2000 to December 2015 will be enrolled in the present study.";

It is caused by inflammation within the small air sacs and small airways of the lungs, which can lead to the destruction of the air sac walls and eventually to airway collapse. Treatment options for emphysema include both non-surgical and surgical interventions. Pulmonary rehabilitation, a non-surgical treatment, includes a combination of education, exercise training, nutrition advice, and smoking cessation programs. The goal of pulmonary rehabilitation is to increase exercise tolerance and reduce breathing difficulties. Two surgical treatment options include lung volume reduction surgery, in which small amounts of damaged lung tissue are removed, and lung transplantation, in which a person's damaged lung is replaced with a healthy lung from a donor. While these surgical options may offer potential improvements in quality of life, they also impose substantial risks, including infections, pneumonia, or even death. In this study, researchers will follow participants over a long period of time to assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation on health outcomes and quality of life.~This study will enroll people with moderate to severe emphysema who have undergone pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, or lung transplantation.

Subjects received either flexible dose clonazepam (0.5 - 2 mg/day) or paroxetine (10 - 40 mg/day), in monotherapy for eight weeks. In the second step, those who responded to monotherapy in the short-term study continued with the same drug and dose. Partial responders or non-responders were invited to receive combined pharmacological treatment with clonazepam and paroxetine. Patients received the maximum tolerated doses of clonazepam and paroxetine. The doses were flexible, ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/day for clonazepam and from 10 to 40 mg/day of paroxetine. All patients were treated for 34 months in the second step. Patients who completed the second step and were in remission were included in the third step. For a period of four months all medications were tapered off. These patients were followed for 6 years with evaluations once a year. Those who relapsed were treated on a naturalistic basis, with drugs or psychotherapy.~This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki and the Brazilian National Ethics Committee (Conselho Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa - CONEP) guidelines. The local Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.";

Studies have established that BNP mediates natriuresis, renin and aldosterone (RAAS) inhibition, vasodilation and lusitropism. Acute cardiac hormone replacement with intravenous infusion of BNP has been shown to possess potent vasodilating actions in humans with acute decompensated CHF resulting in improvement of clinical symptoms. Natrecor (nesiritide) a sterile, purified preparation of human BNP is approved by the FDA for intravenous administration in the treatment of patients with acute decompensated congestive heart failure. However, chronic cardiac hormone replacement with BNP as therapeutic strategy in CHF has been limited by the need to administer BNP intravenously. The objective of this study is to define the cardiorenal and humoral actions of short term (eight weeks) chronic cardiac hormone replacement with subcutaneous (SQ) BNP in human NYHA class II-III CHF. Systolic and diastolic function, left ventricular remodeling as assessed by its volume, renal function, neurohumoral profiling and exercise capacity will be assessed prior to and after eight weeks of treatment.";

The purpose of this study is to examine the treatment results of continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with cisplatin plus early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy with 5-FU and paclitaxel after cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal carcinomatosis.~Objectives:~The primary objective of this study is to determine response and survival after continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with cisplatin and early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy with 5-FU and paclitaxel. Response can only be assessed by measuring the time to clinical or radiographic recurrence of disease.~The secondary objectives include the determination of pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and 5-FU delivered into the peritoneal cavity and the impact that continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with cisplatin and early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy with 5-FU and paclitaxel has on patients' health related quality of life.~The evaluation of pure populations of tumor and normal mesothelial cells to~determine if signal transduction pathways are distinct in tumor versus normal tissue~to see if specific cell pathways are activated or inhibited as a consequence of therapy.~to validate that this technology can provide informative data about these events as a potential surrogate for clinical benefit from therapy or biological behavior of the tumor.~Eligibility:~The patient greater than or equal to 30 kg must have histologically proven peritoneal carcinomatosis from one of the following histologies: 1) primary peritoneal mesothelioma; 2) low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma (including low grade mucinous neoplasms of borderline malignant potential); 3) adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal tract origin (other than low grade mucinous, excluding pancreatic cancer), with disease confined to the peritoneal cavity.

  ex:brief_summaries "In this retrospective observational case study, the investigators review the clinical experience with pressure-pain algometry in children with suspected appendicitis. The investigators hypothesized that algometry can discriminate children with appendicitis from children without appendicitis and aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of algometry, compared to ultrasound imaging and clinical assessment.";
  ex:brief_title "Evaluation of Pressure Algometry in the Clinical Assessment of Acute Abdominal Pain in Children";
  ex:detailed_descriptions "As a retrospective cohort study, participants include all children referred with abdominal pain from January 2000 to June 2006 to one surgeon (R.P.) on the pediatric general surgery service at the Health Sciences Centre (HSC)-Children's Hospital in Winnipeg. The HSC-Children's Hospital is the only pediatric surgery centre within a radius of 600 km. All included participants have had acute abdominal pain ? 7 days, and suspected appendicitis based on standard history and physical exam. Standard appendicitis treatments were used: analgesia, antibiotics, operation. The Research Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba approved the study and reporting of the findings (H2003:104).~The investigators use standard clinical, laboratory, diagnostic imaging procedures for appendicitis diagnosis. The final diagnosis is defined by:~pathology report indicating transmural inflammation, or~from the surgeon's report when pathology was unavailable, or~by discharge diagnosis in non-operated patients.~Appendix rupture is defined by the presence of pus and full-thickness perforation of the appendix wall or abscess formation at operation or on pathology examination. The appendix condition is classified as normal, non-perforated or perforated; all other pathologies at operation are recorded. Treatments, complications and morbidity are tabulated.~Clinical Measures~All patient demographics, clinical presentation details, and results of laboratory testing (WBC) are collated. From this, the components of the Alvarado and Samuel pediatric appendicitis scores (PAS) are calculated retrospectively for comparison purposes and not used in patient management. Time intervals are calculated from the date and time entries in the clinical record. Results of diagnostic abdominal imaging (U/S, CT, plain x-rays) are based on recorded verbal or, if available, official written reports at the time of patient management decision. Equivocal imaging results are deemed negative. The reasons why algometry was not done are tabulated and the number of patients who reached or exceeded the maximum algometer readout (?4 kg)~Algometry Device and Procedure:~The principal investigator (PI) designed and produced in 1983 a simple, lightweight, aluminum-Teflon®, pocket-size, calibrated spring-gauge algometer, similar to a tire gauge, that was used for all measurements. The PI used this routinely in his clinical work.~Children were first familiarized with the algometer and allowed to hold and play with it. The device head was then depressed with increasing force to the child's unencumbered mid-forearm to simulate the abdominal examination and algometry procedure. Children were instructed to indicate with their preferred 'signal' (e.g. 'now', 'ow!', or squeezing the examiner's fingers) when the sensation of pressure changed to a sensation of discomfort or pain. Pressure-pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force (in kilograms) applied via the algometer to produce discomfort. Lower PPT readings imply greater tenderness. All measurements were obtained and recorded by the Principal Investigator. Algometry was a standard tool used by the PI in all clinical practice.~Single mid-forearm 'pressure-pain threshold algometry' (PPTA) measurements are used as the patient's background, 'global', non-abdominal discomfort/pain threshold. This was then followed by single PPTA measurements from the centre of each four abdominal quadrants in the following sequence: left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant. The lower quadrant centre was defined midway between the umbilicus and anterior iliac spines. The upper quadrant centre was defined midway between the umbilicus and mid-costal margins. Algometer depressing velocity (rate) mimicked normal, heuristic palpation velocity (i.e. approximately 1 kg./sec (0.241 kg/cm2/sec or 23.6 kilopascal/sec). From the 5 sites, the investigators define 7 pressure-pain threshold algometric measurements of interest (forearm, left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant, lowest reading, average reading).~Additional algometry 'mapping' is done when the most tender site apparent on qualitative palpation was outside the standard four abdominal quadrants e.g. suprapubic or flank tenderness. If the algometry measurements and qualitative assessment agreed, patients are classified as 'concordant' versus 'discordant' when no agreement. For purposes of analysis, 'discordant' patients are included with the non-mapped group. The site of these maximal abdominal wall tenderness measurements are then correlated with the location of the inflamed appendix found at operation.~The primary analysis is with baseline algometry readings or the final of serial readings. The algometry readings of non-appendicitis appendectomy patients are grouped with non-appendicitis patients.~When available and appropriate, algometry measures are repeated during the period of diagnostic observation to determine if serial PPTA 'mirrored' the patient's clinical course.~From these algometry measures the following ratios are determined:~Abdominal tenderness localizing ratio (ATLR), calculated as the ratio of abdominal tenderness between the least tender (highest PPT) and most tender (or RLQ) quadrants. A higher ATLR indicates a greater degree of tenderness localization within the abdomen; lower ATLR indicates more diffuse tenderness.~Global abdominal tenderness localizing ratio (GTLR), calculated as the ratio of the forearm and most tender (or RLQ) quadrant's (lowest PPT) reading. Higher GTLR indicates a greater degree of tenderness localized to the abdomen relative to the patient's global discomfort/pain threshold. Patients thus serve as their own tenderness control.~For analysis of correlation with clinical variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient R2, are calculated between the 7 PPTA's and age, weight (expressed as a percentile), and duration of symptoms, stratified by gender.~To assess the discriminatory power and predictive values of algometry, we randomly split the data into derivation and validation groups, stratify to gender and final diagnosis of appendicitis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is then performed to identify the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of algometry. The diagnostic accuracy of algometry is compared to ultrasound assessment and clinical diagnosis, again stratified to gender. GraphPad™ is used for all the statistical analysis.";
